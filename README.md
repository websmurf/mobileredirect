# Mobile Redirect plugin for joomla
This plugin allows you to redirect visitors to a different website if they visit your website using a mobile device.

# Usage
In the administrator site of Joomla you can enter a redirect url where people will be redirected when visiting your Joomla website.
Additionally, to skip the redirect, you can add the smr=1 request parameter. This will set a cookie which will skip the redirect when people revisit your website.
